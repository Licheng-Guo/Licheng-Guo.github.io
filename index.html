<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
My name is Licheng Guo. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2022, my M.S. degree in 2021, both in Computer Science from UCLA.
Prior to that I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2018.
</p>

<p>
My research focuses on co-optimizing HLS compilers (from C++ to RTL) and backend implementation tools (from RTL to bitstream)
to improve the performance of domain-specific accelerators. I am the first author of two Best Papers in FPGA'21 and FPGA'22,
based on which I co-founded RapidStream Design Automation after my graudation from UCLA.

<p>
I love travelling and aspire to explore every country of this amazing world :)
