I received my Ph.D. from UCLA in 2022 under Prof. Jason Cong, where I worked on compilers and design automation for customized computing systems. From 2023 to 2025, I was CEO and co-founder of RapidStream Design Automation Inc., where I led a team building a compilation framework to accelerate financial AI models. In 2025, RapidStream was acquired by a major global proprietary trading firm.

My research centers around an end-to-end framework for agile hardware acceleration. Together with colleagues, I developed an ecosystem spanning algorithm to silicon: AutoSA compiles loop nests into high-performance systolic array accelerators (FPGA'21), expressed in our dataflow programming framework Tapa (FCCM'21, TRETS'23), and optimized by our physical timing engines AutoBridge (FPGA'21, ICCAD'25) and RapidStream (FPGA'22, TRETS'23, ICCAD'24). Our open-source programming framework has been used by researchers from more than 30 academic institutions around the world. 

My research was recognized with Best Paper Awards at FPGA'22 and FPGA'21, a Best Paper Nomination at DAC'20, an HACC Research Award from AMD (2022), and an Outstanding Graduate Student Research Award from UCLA (2022).

All of my research at UCLA is public, non-confidential and open-source at my Github repo.
