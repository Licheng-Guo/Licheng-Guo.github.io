I received my Ph.D. from UCLA in 2022 under Prof. Jason Cong, where I worked on compilers and design automation for hardware acceleration systems. From 2023 to 2025, I was CEO and co-founder of RapidStream Design Automation Inc., where I led a team building a compilation framework for deterministic and low-latency trading. RapidStream was acquired by a major global proprietary trading firm.

My research highlight is an end-to-end framework for systolic array accelerators for machine learning. Together with colleagues, I developed an ecosystem spanning algorithm to silicon: AutoSA compiles loop nests into high-performance systolic array architectures (FPGA'21), expressed in our dataflow programming framework Tapa (FCCM'21, TRETS'23), and optimized by our physical timing engines AutoBridge (FPGA'21) and RapidStream (FPGA'22, TRETS'23, ICCAD'24). Our open-source programming framework has been used by researchers from more than 30 academic institutions around the world. 

My research was recognized with Best Paper Awards at FPGA'22 and FPGA'21, a Best Paper Nomination at DAC'20, an HACC Research Award from AMD (2022), and an Outstanding Graduate Student Research Award (2022) from UCLA.

All of my research is public and open-source.
